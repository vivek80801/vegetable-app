# vegetable app

This is a vegetable app. In covid, most of the cities are locked down and it is adviced to stay at home. But for some work, we have to go out of our houses. One of thoes works is purchesing vegetable. In my area, everyone have to go out and buy vegetable buy themselves. There is no online store for vegetable. Also, there is night lockdown in area. Which means you can not go out of your house after 4 o'clock. On the other hand, farmers does not get good price for their product. This app will fill gap between farmers and users. you no longer need to go to outside to purches vegetable.
